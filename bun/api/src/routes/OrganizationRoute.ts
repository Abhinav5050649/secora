/**
 * Routes for the `/organizations` resource. Only an `admin` (or the

 * (creating one) have no `:organization_id` to check a role against, so
 * they only require the caller to be authenticated - see
 * `OrganizationController.post` for how a newly created organization gets
 * its `owner`.
 *
 * - GET    /     - list organizations.
 * - POST   /     - create an organization (caller becomes its owner).
 * - GET    /:organization_id - fetch a single organization (any member).
 * - PATCH  /:organization_id - partially update an organization (admin+).
 * - DELETE /:organization_id - delete an organization (admin+).
